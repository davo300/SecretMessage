# SecretMessage

This program untilizes requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract rows, cells, 
and headers from a public document that has a table with symbols and associated x and y 
coordinates for the given symbol. This program parses each symbol with its xy-coordinates 
and then plots each symbol on a 2D-plane revealing a secret message.
